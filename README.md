# Student API

This API can be used for getting data on students, instructors, and topics for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. I worked with Tom Erickson and Michelle Wood during the Saturday (01/08/2022) class session to live code and get as close to the original as possible.

All data will be returned in JSON format.

Note: Original application created by Tom Erickson
